window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i></b><b>BESTSELLER • Acclaimed author Kevin Hearne makes his hardcover debut with the new novel in his epic urban fantasy series starring the unforgettable Atticus O’Sullivan.</b><br> <br> <b>“[Kevin] Hearne is a terrific storyteller with a great snarky wit. . . . Neil Gaiman’s </b><b><i>American Gods</i></b><b> meets Jim Butcher’s Harry Dresden.”—</b><b><i>SFFWorld</i></b><br> <br> For nearly two thousand years, only one Druid has walked the Earth—Atticus O’Sullivan, the Iron Druid, whose sharp wit and sharp sword have kept him alive as he’s been pursued by a pantheon of hostile deities. Now he’s got company.<br> <br> Atticus’s apprentice Granuaile is at last a full Druid herself. What’s more, Atticus has defrosted an archdruid long ago frozen in time, a father figure (of sorts) who now goes by the modern equivalent of his old Irish name: Owen Kennedy.<br> <br> And Owen has some catching up to do.<br> <br> Atticus takes pleasure in the role reversal, as the student is now the teacher. Between busting Atticus’s chops and trying to fathom a cell phone, Owen must also learn English. For Atticus, the jury’s still out on whether the wily old coot will be an asset in the epic battle with Norse god Loki—or merely a pain in the arse.<br> <br> But Atticus isn’t the only one with daddy issues. Granuaile faces a great challenge: to exorcise a sorcerer’s spirit that is possessing her father in India. Even with the help of the witch Laksha, Granuaile may be facing a crushing defeat.<br> <br> As the trio of Druids deals with pestilence-spreading demons, bacon-loving yeti, fierce flying foxes, and frenzied Fae, they’re hoping that this time, three’s a charm.<br> <br> <b>Don’t miss any of The Iron Druid Chronicles:</b></p> <p><i>Hounded </i></p> <p><i>Hexed </i></p> <p><i>Hammered </i></p> <p><i>Tricked </i></p> <p><i>Trapped </i></p> <p><i>Hunted </i></p> <p><i>Shattered </i></p> <p><i>Staked </i></p> <p><i>Scourged </i></p> <p><i>Besieged</i></p>";
