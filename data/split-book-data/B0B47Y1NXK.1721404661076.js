An inheritance of the Old Farmstead outside of the town of Summer Shandy. It’s overgrown, overrun, and filled with field monsters and in a bad need of a tilling.

With a mountain of chores that range from monster extermination to watering crops, Jason will need to learn to manage his stamina, build up his endurance, and maintain a social life if he’s going to live the quiet life in the country.</p> <p><b>Get a copy of this nostalgic coziness and set off on a warm adventure!</b></p>";
