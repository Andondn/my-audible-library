Then the System arrived.</p> <p>It only took a few hours for their world to become a real-life roleplaying game; trading some downtime for the need to learn new skills and powers while trying to defend their new home, their families, and survive.</p> <p>They don’t know the rules. They don’t know what’s coming next. What they do know is; they need to reinforce and expand their fort while protecting it, keep leveling up, and explore a dangerous new world.</p> <p>Jason and his friends have no choice but to grow as a team in this base-building LitRPG that kicks off a new series.</p>";
