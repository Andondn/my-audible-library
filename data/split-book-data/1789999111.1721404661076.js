But danger lurks in the darkness… </p> <p>Listen to it because: The full story behind the Warhammer Quest: Blackstone Fortress game is revealed! Join Janus Draik and his crew as they venture into the depths of the fortress and encounter all manner of deadly foes. </p> <p>The story: There are those in the great expanse of the galaxy that seek profit wherever it is to be found: the deal makers, the opportunists and explorers – the Rogue Traders. Granted power by an ancient charter, sanctioned by the Emperor Himself, these scoundrels, entrepreneurs and adventurers roam the galaxy in search of fortune and glory. </p> <p>None perhaps are as hungry for these twin vices as Janus Draik. All but disowned by his wealthy family, regarded as a wayward son of ill repute and little potential, Draik knows he must restore his fortunes soon or his misadventures will see him destitute and discarded. </p> <p>So it is then that when he finds a truly exceptional prize, one that will return him to his deserved station, Draik recruits a crew of fellow treasure seekers and sets them to the task. Draik's obsession is all-consuming, and he will risk everything to obtain his prize and its many secrets, including his life or even that of his crew.</p> <p>Written by Darius Hinks.</p>";
