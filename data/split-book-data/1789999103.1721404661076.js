window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Book 3 in the Gaunt's Ghosts series.</p> <p>On the shattered world of Verghast, Gaunt and his Ghosts find themselves embroiled within an ancient and deadly civil war as a mighty hive-city is besieged by an unrelenting foe. </p> <p>Listen to it because: The return of a classic Gaunt's Ghosts novel! The Tanith First deploy to Verghast to help break the Chaos siege of Vervunhive. Tanks clash with daemon engines, Imperial Guardsmen make brave last stands and Colonel-Commissar Gaunt steps up and takes control of the war effort, showing for the first time the command abilities that will go on to make him a legend. </p> <p>The story: On the world of Verghast, a grinding war between two hive cities - one loyal to the Imperium, the other fallen to the worship of the Dark Gods - is bolstered by the forces of the Astra Militarum, spearheaded by the Colonel-Commissar Gaunt and the Tanith First and Only. But bitter rivalries and treachery threaten to derail the defence of Vervunhive, and it falls to Gaunt to take command of the Imperial forces and forge victory from an almost certain defeat. </p> <p>Written by Dan Abnett.</p>";
