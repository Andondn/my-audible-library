window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>It’s time for our sergeant to become a general.</i> </p> <p>Reggie King lives his life in the <i>Armored Souls</i> universe. But there’s more to the game than taking missions as they come. Even turning a secret asteroid base into a kickass man cave only holds appeal for so long. There comes a time when a platoon of mercenaries either needs to join up with a major faction....</p> <p>Or create one. </p> <p>With the founding of Wounded Legion, Reggie takes on responsibility for building and recruiting an elite fighting force capable of conquering planets. But while crummy little independent worlds and uninhabited rocks are easy to capture, the real prizes involve fighting other factions to secure. In the process, Reggie makes enemies, including one troll who refuses to win gracefully. Rather than rough up Wounded Legion and move on, Liberty Clan decides they want to wipe Reggie and his friends off the galactic map. </p> <p>It’s all by the book. The game rules allow it. To avoid extermination, Reggie has to find a way to combat a foe 10 times as powerful as his own. A diplomat might broker a deal. An assassin might go straight for the enemy leader. But Reggie’s a soldier, and he’s going to fight this war the way he knows best.</p>";
