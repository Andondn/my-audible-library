window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Retail never changes, no matter the system used to run it.</p> <p>When Arthur Clark, wage slave and bookworm, takes a bat to the head, he assumes his days of dreary counter minding are over. Instead, a dragon who calls herself a goddess gives him an offer he can't refuse. The job is simple on the surface, manage a store in an apocalyptic city and bring her currency to the people there.</p> <p>Upon arrival at his new home, he finds himself with little more than the clothes on his back and the equivalent of a child's lemonade stand.</p> <p>Alone in an unfamiliar world, Arthur must manage his store, collect new employees, and hunt down his own merchandise. All in a city filled with a variety of threats, both human and not.</p> <p>With taxes owed to the goddess, he'll need to deal with all types to keep up with his bottom line. Wannabe knights, starving survivors, and gangsters who watched too many mafia movies are only a few of the new customers who'll grace his doorstep. Now all he needs to do is to avoid being taken over long enough to call himself an actual manager . . .</p>";
